# What CDK is it?

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmlafeldt%2Fwhatcdkisit)

There are multiple flavors of the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and it's sometimes hard to keep track of them all.

[whatcdkisit.vercel.app](https://whatcdkisit.vercel.app) always tells you the current versions of the most popular CDK projects.

[Built using Next.js (with ISR)](https://artofserverless.com/nextjs-isr-magic/) and Tailwind CSS. Deployed to Vercel. Inspired by [What Rust is it](https://www.whatrustisit.com).
